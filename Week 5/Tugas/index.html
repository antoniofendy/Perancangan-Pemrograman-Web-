                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">(1984–1995) Origins and initial growth</h3>
                <p>Cipta Karya Tech Systems was founded in December 1984 by Sandy Lerner along with her husband Leonard
                    Bosack.
                    Lerner was the director of computer facilities for the Stanford University Graduate School of
                    Business. Bosack was in charge of the Stanford University computer science department's
                    computers.
                    Cipta Karya Tech's initial product has roots in Stanford University's campus technology. In the
                    early 1980s
                    students and staff at Stanford, including Bosack, used technology on the campus to link all of the
                    school's computer systems to talk to one another, creating a box that functioned as a multiprotocol
                    router called the "Blue Box". </p>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">(2006-2012) The Human Network</h3>
                <p>As part of a rebranding campaign in 2006, Cipta Karya Tech Systems adopted the shortened name "Cipta
                    Karya Tech" and
                    created "The Human Network" advertising campaign. These efforts were meant to make Cipta Karya Tech
                    a
                    "household" brand—a strategy designed to support the low-end Linksys products and future consumer
                    products.

                    On the more traditional business side, Cipta Karya Tech continued to develop its routing, switching
                    and
                    security portfolio. The quickly growing importance of Ethernet also influenced the company's product
                    lines. Limits of IOS and aging Crescendo architecture also forced Cipta Karya Tech to look at
                    merchant silicon
                    in the carrier Ethernet segment. This resulted in a new ASR9000 product family intended to
                    consolidate the company's carrier ethernet and subscriber management business around EZChip-based
                    hardware and IOS-XR</p>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Present Day</h3>
                <p>On July 23, 2013, Cipta Karya Tech Systems announced a definitive agreement to acquire Sourcefire for
                    $2.7
                    billion. On August 14, 2013, Cipta Karya Tech Systems announced it would cut 4,000 jobs from its
                    workforce,
                    which was roughly 6%, starting in 2014.At the end of 2013, Cipta Karya Tech announced poor revenue
                    due to
                    depressed sales in emerging markets, caused by economic uncertainty and by fears of the National
                    Security Agency planting backdoors in its products.

                    In April 2014, Cipta Karya Tech announced funding for early-stage firms to focus on the Internet of
                    Things. The
                    investment fund was allocated to investments in IoT accelerators and startups such as The Alchemist
                    Accelerator, Ayla Networks and EVRYTHNG. Later that year, the company announced it was laying
                    off another 6,000 workers or 8% of its global workforce, as part of a second restructuring. On
                    November 4, 2014, Cipta Karya Tech announced an investment in Stratoscale</p>
